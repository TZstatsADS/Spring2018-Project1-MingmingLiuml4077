### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: The effection of big events to presidents's inaugural speeches' sentiments and  topics.
+ This project is conducted by [Mingming Liu]

+ Project summary: Using the lda model and sentiment analysis, I analyze how the big events of America, "Funding of America","Civil War", "World WarI","World WarII","Great Depression","Economic Crisis", effect the inaugural speeches. And I also calculate the relationship between sentiments and topics. Finally, I find these events have big effects to the inaugural speeches. ps: the following website and document are used for reference: https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/treemap-house-of-horror-spooky-eda-lda-features and wk2-Tutorial-TextMining.
